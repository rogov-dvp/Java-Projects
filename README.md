# Welcome to Java Projects

This repository holds Java games that I have developed and would like to showcase.

## Playing the games

Currently there are two games. You can play them by clicking the titles of the games:

### <a href="https://github.com/rogov-dvp/Java-Projects/tree/master/PLAYME">Malzars Maze</a> 

A game in which a player traversers in a maze with limited visibility and collects keys while a minotaur chases you. 

### <a href="https://github.com/rogov-dvp/Java-Projects/tree/master/PLAYME">Brick Breaker Game</a>

A simple game of bouncing a ball off a paddle and breaking bricks.


## Information on the games

Malzars Maze is by far the most intricate game and fully devloped of the two. So let's start with it first
